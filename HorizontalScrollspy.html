                    <h4>Horror</h4>
                    <p>Horror is a genre of speculative fiction that is intended to disturb, frighten, or scare an
                        audience. Horror is often divided into the sub-genres of psychological horror and supernatural
                        horror. Literary historian J. A. Cuddon, in 1984, defined the horror story as "a piece of
                        fiction in prose of variable length ... which shocks, or even frightens the reader, or perhaps
                        induces a feeling of repulsion or loathing".[1] Horror intends to create an eerie and
                        frightening atmosphere for the reader. Often the central menace of a work of horror fiction can
                        be interpreted as a metaphor for larger fears of a society.One defining trait of the horror
                        genre is that it provokes an emotional, psychological, or physical response within readers that
                        causes them to react with fear. One of H. P. Lovecraft's most famous quotes about the genre is
                        that: "The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of
                        fear is fear of the unknown."[35] the first sentence from his seminal essay, "Supernatural
                        Horror in Literature". Science fiction historian Darrell Schweitzer has stated, "In the simplest
                        sense, a horror story is one that scares us" and "the true horror story requires a sense of
                        evil, not in necessarily in a theological sense; but the menaces must be truly menacing,
                        life-destroying, and antithetical to happiness.</p>

                    <h5>Comedy Horror</h5>
                    <p>Comedy horror (also called horror comedy) is a literary, television and film genre that combines
                        elements of comedy and horror fiction. Comedy horror has been described as having three types:
                        "black comedy, parody and spoof."[1] Comedy horror can also parody or subtly spoof horror
                        clichés as its main source of humour or use those elements to take a story in a different
                        direction. Examples of comedy horror films include Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948),
                        An American Werewolf in London (1981), the Evil Dead franchise (1981–present), Gremlins (1984),
                        Shaun of the Dead (2004) and The Cabin in the Woods (2011). In comedy horror film, gallows humor
                        is a common element. While comedy horror films provide scares for audiences, they also provide
                        something that dramatic horror films do not: "the permission to laugh at your fears, to whistle
                        past the cinematic graveyard and feel secure in the knowledge that the monsters can't get you".

                    <h5>Analog Horror</h5>
                    <p>Analog horror is a subgenre of horror fiction commonly characterized by low-fidelity graphics,
                        cryptic messages, little to no traditional jump scares, and visual styles reminiscent of late
                        20th-century television and analog recordings.[3][4][5][6] It is an offshoot of the found
                        footage film genre,[7][3][8] said to have its origins in online horror of the late 2000s and
                        early 2010s, including creepypasta stories[9] such as The Backrooms and found footage series
                        such as No Through Road, and Marble Hornets.[8][3][10][11][12] The genre gained more widespread
                        popularity with the release of Kris Straub's Local 58 in October 2015, with the series' slogan
                        ("ANALOG HORROR AT 476 MHz") providing the genre's name. Analog horror is commonly characterized
                        by low-fidelity graphics, cryptic messages, little to no traditional jump scares, and visual
                        styles reminiscent of late 20th-century television and analog recordings.[3][4][5][6] This is
                        done to match the setting, as analog horror works are typically set somewhere between the 1960s
                        and 1990s, or work with elements from that time period.[3][4] Analog horror is often noted to
                        use visual and audio distortion, as well as glitch-like effects that emphasize and replicate the
                        technological limits the subgenre works with.[13][14] The name "analog horror" comes from the
                        genre's aesthetic incorporation of elements related to analog electronics, such as analog
                        television and VHS (Video Home System), then later being an analog method of recording video and
                        audio.[3][4][15]

                        The genre is also known to show manipulated pre-existing media from the time period it is trying
                        to imitate, as seen in series like The Mandela Catalogue.[3][16] Oftentimes, analog horror works
                        use their formats' supposed limitations to their advantage. Analog effects and graphics
                        frequently obscure or abstract events such that the viewers are left to wonder at, and
                        consequently fear, what they are witnessing.[3] Works such as The Backrooms use the limitations
                        of the equipment that they are replicating to disguise the use of Blender and Adobe After
                        Effects, making the series appear more visually realistic.[17]

                        Analog horror may also be influenced by horror films such as The Ring (1998), The Blair Witch
                        Project (1999) and Paranormal Activity (2007).[3][18][19] David Lynch's Inland Empire and the
                        musical subgenre vaporwave heavily influenced Petscop,[20][21][22] a web series rooted in analog
                        horror.</p>

                    <h4>Action</h4>
                    <p>The action film is a film genre that predominantly features chase sequences, fights, shootouts,
                        explosions, and stunt work. The specifics of what constitutes an action film has been in
                        scholarly debate since the 1980s. While some scholars such as David Bordwell suggested they were
                        films that favor spectacle to storytelling, others such as Geoff King stated they allow the
                        scenes of spectacle to be attuned to storytelling. Action films are often hybrid with other
                        genres, mixing into various forms such as comedies, science fiction films, and horror films.

                        While the term "action film" or "action adventure film" has been used as early as the 1910s, the
                        contemporary definition usually refers to a film that came with the arrival of New Hollywood and
                        the rise of anti-heroes appearing in American films of the late 1960s and 1970s drawing from war
                        films, crime films and Westerns. These genres were followed by what is referred to as the
                        "classical period" in the 1980s. This was followed by the post-classical era where American
                        action films were influenced by Hong Kong action cinema and the growing using of computer
                        generated imagery in film. Following the September 11 attacks, a return to the early forms of
                        the genre appeared in the wake of Kill Bill and The Expendables films.

                        Scott Higgins wrote in 2008 in Cinema Journal that action films are both one of the most popular
                        and popularly derided of contemporary cinema genres, stating that "in mainstream discourse, the
                        genre is regularly lambasted for favoring spectacle over finely tuned narrative."[2] Bordwell
                        echoed this in his book, The Way Hollywood Tells It, writing that the reception to the genre as
                        being "the emblem of what Hollywood does worst."[</p>

                    <h4>Science Fiction</h4>
                    <p>Science fiction (often shortened to sci-fi or abbreviated SF) is the genre of speculative fiction
                        that imagines advanced and futuristic scientific progress and typically includes elements like
                        information technology and robotics, biological manipulations, space exploration, time travel,
                        parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. The genre often specifically explores human
                        responses to the consequences of these types of projected or imagined scientific advances.

                        Science fiction's precise definition has long been disputed among authors, critics, scholars,
                        and readers. It contains many subgenres include hard science fiction, which emphasizes
                        scientific accuracy, and soft science fiction, which focuses on social sciences. Other notable
                        subgenres are cyberpunk, which explores the interface between technology and society, climate
                        fiction, which addresses environmental issues, and space opera, which emphasizes pure adventure
                        in a universe in which space travel is common.

                        Precedents for science fiction are claimed to exist as far back as antiquity. Some books written
                        in the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment Age were considered early science-fantasy
                        stories. The modern genre arose primarily in the 19th and early 20th centuries, when popular
                        writers began looking to technological progress for inspiration and speculation. Mary Shelley's
                        Frankenstein, written in 1818, is often credited as the first true science fiction novel. Jules
                        Verne and H. G. Wells are pivotal figures in the genre's development. In the 20th century, the
                        genre grew during the Golden Age of Science Fiction; it expanded with the introduction of space
                        operas, dystopian literature, and pulp magazines.

                        Science fiction has come to influence not only literature, but also film, television, and
                        culture at large. Science fiction can criticize present-day society and explore alternatives, as
                        well as provide entertainment and inspire a sense of wonder.</p>

                    <h5>Cyberpunk</h5>
                    <p>Cyberpunk is a subgenre of science fiction set in a dystopian future. It is characterized by its
                        focus on a combination of "low-life and high tech".[1] It features a range of futuristic
                        technological and scientific achievements, including artificial intelligence and cyberware,
                        which are juxtaposed with societal collapse, dystopia or decay.[2] A significant portion of
                        cyberpunk can be traced back to the New Wave science fiction movement of the 1960s and 1970s.
                        During this period, prominent writers such as Philip K. Dick, Michael Moorcock, Roger Zelazny,
                        John Brunner, J. G. Ballard, Philip José Farmer and Harlan Ellison explored the impact of
                        technology, drug culture, and the sexual revolution. These authors diverged from the utopian
                        inclinations prevalent in earlier science fiction.

                        Comics exploring cyberpunk themes began appearing as early as Judge Dredd, first published in
                        1977.[3] Released in 1984, William Gibson's influential debut novel Neuromancer helped solidify
                        cyberpunk as a genre, drawing influence from punk subculture and early hacker culture. Frank
                        Miller's Ronin is an example of a cyberpunk graphic novel. Other influential cyberpunk writers
                        included Bruce Sterling and Rudy Rucker. The Japanese cyberpunk subgenre began in 1982 with the
                        debut of Katsuhiro Otomo's manga series Akira, with its 1988 anime film adaptation (also
                        directed by Otomo) later popularizing the subgenre.</p>

                <div id="item-3-2">
                    <h5>Steampunk</h5>
                    <p>Steampunk is a subgenre of science fiction that incorporates retro-futuristic technology and
                        aesthetics prominently inspired by 19th-century industrial steam-powered machinery and
                        design.[1][2][3] Steampunk works are often set in an alternative history of the Victorian
                        era or the American frontier where steam power remains in mainstream use, or in a fantasy
                        world that similarly employs steam power.

                        Steampunk features anachronistic technologies or retro-futuristic inventions as people in
                        the 19th century might have envisioned them – distinguishing it from Neo-Victorianism[4] –
                        and is likewise rooted in the era's perspective on fashion, culture, architectural style,
                        and art.[5] Such technologies may include fictional machines like those found in the works
                        of H. G. Wells and Jules Verne.[6] Other examples of steampunk contain alternative
                        history-style presentations of such technology as steam cannons, lighter-than-air airships,
                        analog computers or such digital mechanical computers as Charles Babbage's Analytical
                        Engine.[7][8]

                        Steampunk may also incorporate additional elements from the genres of fantasy, horror,
                        historical fiction, alternate history or other branches of speculative fiction, making it
                        often a hybrid genre.[9] As a form of speculative fiction, it explores alternative futures
                        or pasts but can also address real-world social issues.[10] The first known appearance of
                        the term steampunk was in 1987, though it now retroactively refers to many works of fiction
                        created as far back as the 1950s or earlier.[11] A popular subgenre is Japanese steampunk,
                        consisting of steampunk-themed manga and anime.[12]

                        Steampunk also refers to any of the artistic styles, clothing fashions, or subcultures that
                        have developed from the aesthetics of steampunk fiction, Victorian-era fiction, art nouveau
                        design, and films from the mid-20th century.[13] Various modern utilitarian objects have
                        been modded by individual artisans into a pseudo-Victorian mechanical 'steampunk' style, and
                        a number of visual and musical artists have been described as steampunk.</p>
